--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------MALWARE

-Ways to spread Mechanism
1. Propagation Mechanism
2. Payload

1. Viruses - SPREAD THROUGHT ACTION 
2. Worm - SPREAD BY THEMSELVES- First outbreak in 1988, was written Robert T. Morris
3. Trojan Horse - POSE AS BENEFICIAL SOFTWARE - (RAT) Remote Access Trojan

1. Adware - Online Ads(Pop-up advertisement, legimate ads, search engine)
2. Spyware - Gathers Information without user's consent. (Key Stoke, Web Browsing, search hard drive and cloud storage)
3. Ransomware - Block acccess - (Arrives via email attachment, Encrypts local files)

-Preventing Malware
1. Anti-malware software
2. Security Patches
3. User Education

-Backdoors and logic bombs
1. Backdoors - provide workaround acccess(hardcoded accounts,default passwords, unknown acccess, Unknown access channels)
2. Logic Bombs - Deliver a triggered payload(file content, API call result, Date/Time reached)

-Advance Malware
1. Rootkits - escalate user priviledges(Backdoors, botnet agents, adware/spyware, anti-theft mechanism)
	-user mode rootkits
		1.Run with normal user priviledges
		2. Are easy to write and difficult to detect
	-Kernel mode rootkits
		1.Run with system priviledges
		2. Are difficult to detect and easy to detect
2. Polymorphism - changing their own code, Using encryption
3. Armored Viruses - Prevent reverse engineering

-Undersyand Botnets
Botnets - renting out computing power, delivering spam, DDos attacks, BitCoin
	- Commands and control networks relay orders
	- Commincation must be indirect and redundant
		-Internet Relay Char(IRC)
		-Twitter
		-Peer to peer withing the botnet

-Advanced persisten threats - ZERO-Day Vulnerability
1. Notify the vendor of the vulnerability
